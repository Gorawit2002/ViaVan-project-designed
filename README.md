# 🚐 ViaVan – Van Tracking & Booking System

A software engineering project designed to address common issues in university shuttle services by building a smart, centralized van tracking and reservation platform.

---

## 📌 Overview

ViaVan is a system proposed for real-time **van tracking** and **seat booking** to improve transportation efficiency for students and staff. The project focuses on solving pain points such as long wait times, route uncertainty, and lack of seat availability through a user-centric web and mobile solution.

Although not yet implemented in code, the system has been **fully designed and specified** through comprehensive documentation.

## 🧠 Key Features (Planned)

- 📍 **Real-time Van Location Tracking** (via GPS)
- 📆 **Seat Reservation System** (First-come, First-serve with cancellation)
- 🧾 **Booking History and Notifications**
- 🗺️ **Interactive Route Map** with van ETA
- 👥 **Multi-role Access**: Passenger, Driver, Admin
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** (Admin-side)
